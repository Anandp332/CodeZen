This problem was asked by Facebook.
Given an array, find the subarray (containing at least k numbers) which has the largest sum. You have to print that largest sum.
Input Format:
In the first line of input, you are given with the array size, next line of input contains the input array and the next line gives you the value of k.
Constraints:
Time Limit: 1 second
The size of array lies in the range: [1, 100000]
The value of array elements lies in the range: [-1000, 1000]
The value of k lies in the range: [1, size of array].
Output Format:
Value of largest sum for a subarray(containing at least k elements).
Sample Input 1:
6
1 1 1 1 1 1
2
Sample Input 2:

Explanation:
If we include all the elements of input array in the subarray, it will give us the maximum sum here. So, the subarray is:
